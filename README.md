# Memory Game!

## Description

This is Project 2/Memory Game for Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree.

Created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Game board design/layout provided by Udacity. Shuffle function provided by http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976

## How To Play

Click any tile to reveal the icon. On first click, the match begins along with the timer. The goal is to match all tiles in the least amount of moves. The more moves you make, the lower your star rating will be. There is no penalty for duration. Just do your best!

Just for fun, I've added alternate text for over 30 and 35 moves. Feel free to purposely mismatch that many times...
